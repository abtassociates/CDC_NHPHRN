<h2>Protocol Descriptions</h2>
Public Use Files (PUFs) generated as part of CDC's NHPHRN are posted in this repository.  To date, PUF files have been posted for one NHPHRN protocol (Kinetics of SARS-CoV-2 Shedding in Nursing Home Staff and Residents Protocol)


<h3>Kinetics of SARS-CoV-2 Shedding in Nursing Home Staff and Residents (INHERENT) Protocol</h3>

<p>The INHERENT study was conducted as part of the Nursing Home Public Health Response Network (NHPHRN). The NHPHRN serves as a national public health research and surveillance network and is composed of a diverse network of academic sites that have nursing homes across the United States (U.S.) within their network. Established in September 2022, the NHPHRN includes eight U.S.-based academic institutions (study sites) with expertise in NH research. Working within their existing NH research networks, each study site identified NHs willing to participate in the national NHPHRN. There are currently eighty-seven nursing homes participating in the NHPHRN network, though not all nursing homes participated in the INHERENT study. The NHPHRN is funded by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC; contract number 75D30121D12704).</p>

<p>The studies objectives were: 
  <ul>
    <li>Primary objective: Characterize the kinetics of SARS-CoV-2 shedding including proliferation, peak, and clearance using qRT-PCR, antigen testing, genetic sequencing, and culture among NH residents and staff using different testing approaches and examine the influence of different factors including participant characteristics (e.g., vaccination status, prior infection, symptom status, receipt of treatment) and circulating variant. </li>
    <li>Sub-study objective: Assess the long-term (>14 days) duration of SARS-CoV-2 positivity using qRT-PCR, antigen testing, genetic sequencing, and culture. </li>
  </ul>

<h2>Data Use Agreement</h2>
<p></p>Abt Global, LLC (Abt) is pleased to offer downloadable Nursing Home Public Health Response Network (NHPHRN) Kinetics of SARS-CoV-2 Shedding in Nursing Home Staff and Residents (INHERENT) public use data files. The NHPHRN is funded by the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) (contract and order number 75D30121D12704/75D30122F00001). Users have access to data sets and documentation from the NHPHRN data collection systems. Downloading instructions are available in “readme” files.</p>

<p>Public use data files are prepared and disseminated to provide access to the full scope of the data. This allows researchers to manipulate the data in a format appropriate for their analyses. </p>

<p>Users of the NHPHRN public-use data files must comply with data use restrictions to ensure that the information will be used solely for statistical analysis or reporting purposes. If you have questions about the data or its use, please contact NHPHRN_INHERENT@abtassoc.com.</p>

<p>CDC and Abt expect that users of the NHPHRN INHERENT data files will adhere to the following standards for the analysis and reporting of research data. All research results should be presented and/or published in a manner that protects the confidentiality of participants. INHERENT data will not be presented and/or published in any way in which an individual can be identified. Therefore, users will:
<ol>
<li>Not attempt to link nor permit others to link the data with individually identified records in another database.</li>
<li>	Not attempt to learn the identity of any participant in the data and will not deliberately combine this data with other CDC or non-CDC data for the purpose of matching records to identify individuals. If you should inadvertently discover the identity of any participant, you will ensure the identities of any participants are kept confidential, and not used in any publications and/or presentations.</li>
<li>Not imply or state, either in written or oral form, that interpretations based on analysis of the data reflect official CDC policies or positions.</li>
<li>Understand that INHERENT was a voluntary study that was conducted at select nursing homes and, therefore, information from INHERENT might not be representative or generalizable of all US nursing home residents or staff members.</li>
</ol></p>
<p></p>By using this data you signify your understanding of the above-stated terms.</p>

<h2>How to Download Data</h2>
<p>The PUFs are posted in csv format, with 9 separate files representing subsets of the INHERENT dataset. The data dictionary excel sheet contains 9 separate tabs representing data dictionaries for each of the INHERENT datset subsets.
